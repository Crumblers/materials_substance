Preferences section of the add-on 
(Collapsed by default, click on "Preferences" in the add-on main panel to expand it)
Contains the fields to edit the prefix, Separator and the Pattern selector for the image texture names as well as the toggle for the "Advanced Mode" of the add-on.
***
**Prefix**

There you can edit the prefix of the file names you wish to import. 
The script should detect it and prefill the field automatically if the selected material name is compatible when selecting the Texture maps folder. ( if the material name is present in the file names from the Texture map folder )

Usually the name of your project in Substance but could also be the name the object or something entirely different included in the target file names.
(**Note**: According to the file name pattern, the prefix could be placed second, third or even not at all in the file names) 

***

**Separator**\
Field used to edit the separator character in the image file name. By default set to "_ _ _" (1 x underscore). If your file names have a different separator you should adjust it accordingly.
For exemple if the textures file names looks like "prefix-MaterialName-Color.png" you should set it to "-" (1 x minus)
**Important: **The script doesn't prefill it automatically, this should be adjusted manually if the separator in the file names is not "_ _ _" (1 x underscore)
